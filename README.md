## Design

- #### Site design 
  Researching websites for other cafes and coffee shops, I was most drawn to the websites that had a clean and clear aesthetic. I went with a clean colour scheme and focused on the two main features of the cafe: Cats and Boba tea.

  The Puss-N-Boba website needed to be responsive and available on a variety of screen sizes and devices to make it as accessible as possible. I focused on the following sizes:

  1. Mobile Device dimensions (small): 280px x 653px
  2. Mobile Device dimensions (larger): 375px and larger
  3. Tablet Device dimensions: 736px and larger
  4. Laptop Device dimensions: 992px and larger 
- #### Wireframes
  Initially, I started by creating the initial Puss-N-Boba website wireframes with pencil and paper. After sketching out what I planned, I started laying out the HTML and basic CSS for the site in a similar way that the Love Running tutorial went.

  However, I found this process to be lacking the information and details such as the colours and fonts when using too simple a wireframe. So, part way through the process, I took my wireframes to Photoshop where I worked on the color palette, typography, and imagery in greater detail.

  <summary>Desktop Wireframes</summary>  

  ![screenshot desktop wireframes](docs/documentation/screenshot_wireframe_desktop.png)
  </details>    
- #### Colour 
  ![screenshot of font family](docs/documentation/screenshot_color_palette.png)
  Preferring a clean and bright aesthetic that reflected the cheeryful and pleasant interior of the cafe, the colors are designed to reflect that clean and modern aesthetic while still be fun and punchy. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Initially, my buttons featured white text and this, in combination with the orange background, failed the acceptable [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html) contrast ratio. Ultimately, I chose to change the text color to the same color as the rest of the website's font color to ensure readability and accessibility. I used the [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer) to test the colors.

  ![screenshot of adobe color analysis](docs/documentation/screenshot_colorcontrast.png)
- #### Typography
  The font family is Montserrat. It was chosen for it's clean look, readability, and variety of weights.

</details>
The overall design of the website continues on the About Page featuring a Hero style image at the top with overlay text highlighting the main feature of the cafe with both imagery and copy. Below the hero image, there is a summary of the main features of the cafe. The tablet and laptop layouts are similar but the mobile version switches the content to a column layout.

<details>
<summary></summary>

![screenshot of menu page](docs/documentation/screenshot_features_menu.webp)
</details>
The design of the menu page follows the overall the design set by the Home page with a hero image at the top with a short amount of copy summarizing the content of the page.

Again, the tablet and laptop layouts are similar but the mobile versions switches to a column layout.

The Cats Page also follows the overall design set by the Home page with a hero image at the top with a heading describing the page. The page features a small amount of text describing the cats that live at the cafe and then feature a section of cat profiles that provide a small description of each cat along with an image of the cat. The screenshot is of the tablet layout and the cat profiles are displayed as two across. On screensizes of a laptop or larger, this cat profile layout changes to three cats across while the mobile version displays in a column layout.

### Contact Form
<details>
<summary></summary>

![screenshot of contact page](docs/documentation/screenshot_features_contact.webp)

The other main feature of the website is the contact form which allows the user to contact the cafe directly.

  ### Manual Testing
  Manual testing was performed on the website checking for broken links, content errors, and responsivity across different sizes. Testing took place during the build process using Dev Tools on Chrome and on the following real-world devices and browsers:

  #### Devices 
  1. Pixel 4XL
  2. Xiaomi 11T Pro
  3. Redmi Note 12 Pro+
  4. Lenovo IdeaPad Y500 Laptop
  5. Alienware Aurora R7 Desktop
  6. Microsoft Surface

  #### Browsers
  1. Microsoft Edge
  2. Brave
  3. Google Chrome
  4. Opera

  #### The results of testing are as follows:
  | Page | Test | Pass/Fail |
  | ---- | ---- | --------- |
  | All  | Puss-n-Boba logo links back to the homepage | Pass |
  | All  | Underline appears on hover when moving over navigation bar links | Pass |
  | All  | Underline appears on corresponding navigation link when on the page | Pass |
  | All  | Navigation links direct user correctly to the correct page | Pass |
  | All  | Footer social media icons open in a new tab and correctly bring user to the corresponding social media website | Pass |
  | All  | Images and sections are responsive to different device sizes | Pass |
  | Index  | Links on the homepage bring user to the correct page | Pass |
  | Contact | Contact form correctly requires entries into fields | Pass |
  | Contact | Contact form submission works corrrectly and brings user to a validation page | Pass |
  | Contact | Google Maps is interactive and opens in a new tab when the user clicks on "view larger map" | Pass |

  #### Bugs and Fixes
  | Bug | Page | Fix |
  | --- | ---- | --- |
  | Missing </ul> | Menu page | I had left out the close tag for my last set of unordered lists. I closed the tag and the error was resolved. |
  | Nesting a submit button inside an a element | Contact page | I had attempted to test a way to have the contact form direct the user to a confirmation page rather than the Code Institute form validator but it was not a working solution. I removed the anchor tag and the bug was resolved |
  | Div not allowed as a child of the submit button | Contact page | I had previously used a div to style the buttons on the index page. However, divs were not allowed as a child of a submit button in a form. I moved the class to the submit button classes and removed the div and this resolved the bug. |
  | Missmatching labels and ids for the contact form fields | Contact page | I had accidentally used a "-" rather than an "_" when labeling the fields for the contact form. I corrected this mistake and this resolved the bug. |
  | Color Contrast failure for accessibility on orange buttons | Index & Contact pages | After running a Lighthouse audit on Google Dev Tools, I saw that the white text on the orange buttons failed the color contrast analyzer. I adjusted the color for easier readability and accessability. |
  | Hero images are loading to slow and lowering website performance | Index, About, and Menu pages | I uploaded smaller file sized images for the mobile and tablet screen sizes. This resolved the issue. |

  ### Unfixed Bugs
  - Lower SEO Lighthouse score due to Blocking directive: x-robots-tag: noindex, nofollow. I could not find any code matching this in my website. So, I am unsure why the website sends this message to search engines. I will need to do more research to find out what is the cause for this.
  - Lighthouse audits revealed that the contact page had a Best Practices issue that involved caching of third-party cookies. Primarily, the offending feature was the google maps iframe. After researching the topic, I was unsure how to improve this on my end since it required me to be able to set the cache time to a longer period of time to allow the website to load a cached version of the map for repeat users. Since I was unable to figure out how to do this in an IDE environment, I decided that for the scope of this project, I would have to leave this bug unresolved at this time.
  - Lighthouse audits also occasionally revealed that javascript that allowed the footer icons to load from the third-party website https://fontawesome.com/ also did not always run optimally. This was not a solution I could resolve on my end without foregoing using third-party assets. To resolve this, I could have created my own icons instead of relying on a third-party site.
