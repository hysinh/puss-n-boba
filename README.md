## Introduction
Welcome to Puss-N-Boba, a (fictional) boba cafe who’s special feature is that we are also a cat cafe for those that love working and socialising in the presence of cats! Puss-N-Boba cafe aims to provide delicious boba and treats as well as a cat-filled environment for those relaxing or working. We provide high-speed internet, loads of power outlets, and comfy and cozy seating that works for those lounging for a relaxing chat with a friend or working away on your latest project or studies.

I wanted this website to showcase the cats that call Puss-N-Boba cafe home as well as our other main feature - Boba and Treats - and the location itself as an ideal place to meet a friend or work or study. To reflect the inviting environment of the cafe, the website also features similar colours and images of the cats and the boba and treats to encourage customers to visit the cafe.

## Design

- #### Site design 
  Researching websites for other cafes and coffee shops, I was most drawn to the websites that had a clean and clear aesthetic. I went with a clean colour scheme and focused on the two main features of the cafe: Cats and Boba tea.
- #### Colour 
  (insert image of colours scheme)
  Preferring a clean and bright aesthetic that reflected the cheeryful and pleasant interior of the care, the colors are designed to reflect that clean and modern aesthetic while still be fun and punchy.
- #### Typography
  The font family is Montserrat. It was chosen for it's clean look, readability, and variety of weights.

  ![screenshot of font family](docs/documentation/screenshot_font_montserrat.png)
- #### Wireframes
  I started by creating the initial website wireframes with pencil and paper. After sketching out what I planned, I started laying out the HTML and basic CSS for the site in a similar way that the Love Running tutorial went.
  <br>
  I found this to not be my design style and cumbersome. As a designer, I really needed a more solid game plan for the website and switched to Adobe Photoshop and completed the wireframes designs in Photoshop.

  - #### Manual Testing
    Manual testing was performed on the website checking for broken links, content errors, and responsivity across different sizes. Testing took place during the build process using Dev Tools on Chrome and on the following real-world devices and browsers:
     1. Microsoft Edge
     2. Brave
     3. Google Chrome
     4. Opera

     The results of testing are as follows:

     | Page | Test | Pass/Fail |
     | ---- | ---- | --------- |
     | All  | Puss-n-Boba logo links back to the homepage | Pass |
     | All  | Underline appears on hover when moving over navigation bar links | Pass |
     | All  | Underline appears on corresponding navigation link when on the page | Pass |
     | All  | Navigation links direct user correctly to the correct page | Pass |
     | All  | Footer social media icons open in a new tab and correctly bring user to the corresponding social media website | Pass |
     | All  | Images and sections are responsive to different device sizes | Pass |
     | Index  | Links on the homepage bring user to the correct page | Pass |
     | Contact | Contact form correctly requires entries into fields | Pass |
     | Contact | Contact form submission works corrrectly and brings user to a validation page | Pass |
     | Contact | Google Maps is interactive and opens in a new tab when the user clicks on "view larger map" | Pass |

  - #### Bug & Fixes
      | Bug | Page | Fix |
      | --- | ---- | --- |
      | Missing </ul> | Menu page | I had left out the close tag for my last set of unordered lists. I closed the tag and the error was resolved. |
      | Nesting a submit button inside an a element | Contact page | I had attempted to test a way to have the contact form direct the user to a confirmation page rather than the Code Institute form validator but it was not a working solution. I removed the <a> tag and the bug was resolved |
      | Div not allowed as a child of the submit button | Contact page | I had previously used a div to style the buttons on the index page. However, divs were not allowed as a child of a submit button in a form. I moved the class to the submit button classes and removed the div and this resolved the bug. |
      | Missmatching labels and ids for the contact form fields | Contact page | I had accidentally used a "-" rather than an "_" when labeling the fields for the contact form. I corrected this mistake and this resolved the bug. |
      | Color Contrast failure for accessibility on orange buttons | Index & Contact pages | After running a Lighthouse audit on Google Dev Tools, I saw that the white text on the orange buttons failed the color contrast analyzer. I adjusted the color for easier readability and accessability. |
      | Hero images are loading to slow and lowering website performance | Index, About, and Menu pages | I uploaded smaller file sized images for the mobile and tablet screen sizes. This resolved the issue. |

  - ### Unfixed Bugs
    -  Lower SEO Lighthouse score due to Blocking directive: x-robots-tag: noindex, nofollow. I could not find any code matching this in my website. So, I am unsure why the website sends this message to search engines. I will need to do more research to find out what is the cause for this.
